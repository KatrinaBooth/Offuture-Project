<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the final assignment for the Communicating Technology module at Digital Futures Academy. Over 2.5 days, I performed a descriptive analysis of Offture's sales data from 2011 to 2015 in SQL, identifying key trends and performance metrics across the time period. The analysis aimed to summarize the data, highlight notable advantages and challenges, and present the findings in a clear and insightful way to support informed decision-making. Visualisations were created using Tabealu, along with a comprehensive dashboard showing all analysis. Following the analysis, I presented the results to the cohort, providing actionable insights and recommendations based on the data.

<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes

* Profit doubled from 2011 to 2014, with Q4 always performing best.
* This was also reflected in the sales figures.
* Smaller, more disposable items such as binder covers, highlighters, and ring binders are top-sellers.
* Conversely, the most profitable products are typically larger, more expensive, and long-lasting items, such as copiers, stoves, and phones.
* Overall, selling tables has cost the company $64k.
* Order priority is consistent across all countries, despite their contribution to sales and profitability.
* This was also reflected in the global shipping times.
* USA generated the most sales.
